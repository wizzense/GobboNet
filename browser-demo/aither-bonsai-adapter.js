/* AitherOS ↔ GobboNet adapter — run GobboNet's chat on an in-browser Bonsai model.
 *
 * GobboNet (Elodine / GoblinCorps, MIT) talks to llama.cpp over an OpenAI-compatible
 * endpoint. That is the whole integration surface: swap the transport and every one of its
 * features — character cards, lorebooks, threads, personas, macros — keeps working unchanged.
 * Nothing in the upstream tree is patched. This file is additive and removable.
 *
 * ── Why this hooks `privacyFetch` and not `window.fetch` ────────────────────────────────
 * `js/02-model.js:398` defines `privacyFetch(url, options)` as a one-line pass-through to
 * fetch. Every CHAT network call GobboNet makes goes through it, and because the app ships
 * as plain <script> tags with no bundler, it is a GLOBAL. Reassigning it reroutes the app
 * without touching a line of it. Hooking `window.fetch` instead would also intercept the
 * page's own asset loads and anything else on the origin — a strictly larger blast radius
 * for no gain there.
 *
 * The MODEL SELECTOR is a separate story: js/02-model.js's active-model / models-list /
 * swap-model / swap-status calls go through the raw global `fetch`, not `privacyFetch` — a
 * completely different subsystem talking to launch.bat's companion fileserver.ps1. Below,
 * `window.fetch` IS hooked, but narrowly: matched on an exact pathname allowlist of those
 * four routes only, falling through to the real fetch for everything else. See "The model
 * selector" section near the bottom for why.
 *
 * ── The four routes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   /llm/jobs*                  -> 404, ON PURPOSE. `startGenerationJob` treats 404/405 as
 *                                  "this server has no job spool", latches `jobsAvailable =
 *                                  false`, and falls through to direct streaming for the
 *                                  rest of the session. Job mode is a fileserver.ps1
 *                                  feature (a server-side spool that survives navigation);
 *                                  there is no server here, so we decline it in the one way
 *                                  the app already understands.
 *   /llm/health                 -> honest capability check (see below), not a hardcoded ok.
 *   /llm/v1/chat/completions    -> an SSE stream fed from the Bonsai worker.
 *   /llm/v1/models              -> the browser-runnable catalogue.
 * Everything else passes straight through to the original.
 *
 * ── The emitted wire format is not "OpenAI-ish", it is what THEY parse ─────────────────
 * `extractTokenFromLine` (js/02-model.js:411) reads `choices[0].delta.content` for answer
 * text and `delta.reasoning_content` for chain-of-thought, and stops on `data: [DONE]`.
 * Our worker already separates those as `channel: "thinking" | "answer"`, so the mapping is
 * one-to-one. Emitting a shape it does not parse would show up as a silent empty reply —
 * the model runs, tokens stream, and nothing appears.

  // memory cannot leave a turn hanging forever, and it is only ever checked BEFORE the first
  // token. A slow-but-alive turn must never be cut off — this runtime does ~1.9 tok/s on an
  // Iris Xe and that is a working session, and a fabricated failure is worse than a hang
  // because nobody can debug an error that did not happen.
  // Must equal device-class.ts on THIS branch, which BIH005 asserts. A LONGER copy

  // This file probes eight loopback ports every 4 s with no such gate, on that same
  // origin. Reported 2026-08-23: the taskbar read "find my node" (state 'not-probed' --
  // honest, it had never looked) while this adapter had already found the adk daemon and
  // the banner beside it said "Running on YOUR machine -- aither-orchestrator". Two
  // surfaces, one machine, opposite answers, and the OS was the one telling the truth
  // about what it had measured.
  //
  // OPENING GOBBONET IS THAT EXPLICIT ACT. It is not the landing page: it is an app whose
  // entire subject is local inference, framed same-origin as an OS window
  // (components/os/website-pages.ts), whose own header says "AWDK ON YOUR MACHINE". A
  // visitor who opened it has asked the question at least as plainly as one who opened
  // Setup. So record it in the SAME key the OS reads, rather than keeping a second,
  // ungoverned answer -- and the OS's `storage` listener flips the chip in the same tick
  // instead of on its next poll.
  //
  // Recording the act does NOT widen it: this adapter was already probing, so nothing
  // starts scanning that was not scanning before. What changes is that the scan is now
  // ATTRIBUTABLE and REVOCABLE through the control the OS already ships
  // (disableLocalNodeProbing / Setup), where before it was neither.

  // fileserver.ps1. Without this, those four calls hit the real (nonexistent) static paths,

  // is stuck on the ONE hardcoded fallback option: "Custom GGUF" — regardless of whether a

  // Fixed by wrapping the two GLOBALS that write those nodes, exactly as `privacyFetch` is
  // wrapped, because upstream is vendored and never edited (build-gobbonet.mjs). Wrapping
  // rather than one-shot patching is what survives a re-render: `renderLandingPage` rewrites
  // the whole landing surface on every thread change, and a DOM edit applied once is undone
  // the first time the visitor clicks HOME.

   *   'node'        a real awdk node answered on loopback; it outranks the browser.
   *   'unsupported' this browser exposes no WebGPU adapter, so we can never serve a token.
   *   'ready'       the worker posted 'ready'; weights are in and a turn can start NOW.

   SMART AUTO-SCROLL
   scrollToBottom() above is the FORCE variant — always scrolls,
   used by user-initiated actions (send, switch thread, reroll,
   edit-save, etc.). The helpers below are the AUTO variants used
   by streaming-tick calls: they only scroll if the user is still
   pinned at the bottom. If the user scrolled up to read history,
   they stay put and chunks pass underneath until they scroll back
   down — no button, no opt-in, just respect the user's position.
================================================================ */

   FOLLOW-TO-BOTTOM CONTROL
   The streaming auto-scroll (autoScrollToBottom) only chases the
   bottom while scrollPinnedToBottom is true. On mobile the old
   "scroll up far enough to unpin" gesture had to win a tug-of-war
   against the per-chunk scrollToBottom(), which kept slamming the
   viewport back to the bottom faster than a thumb could drag a row
   clear — so stopping the auto-scroll on a phone was a fight the
   user usually lost. Unpinning is now ALSO driven by a direct touch
   on the message area during generation (see attachScrollPinTracking),
   which is deterministic: one touch on the stream and following stops.

   Once unpinned, fresh tokens push the latest reply below the fold.
   This FAB then surfaces and, when tapped, re-pins and snaps to the
   bottom so following resumes.
================================================================ */

// How far below the fold (px) before the FAB appears. Comfortably
// larger than the 32px pin threshold so it doesn't flicker in the
// instant the user is basically at the bottom — it shows only once a
// real slice of content has scrolled out of view ("flooding out").
const FOLLOW_BTN_REVEAL_DIST = 120;

// viewport at the bottom (the caller scrollToBottom()s), but
// renderMessages() resets scrollTop to 0 synchronously first, so an
// updateFollowButton() that runs in between (via updateInputState in
// render()) would read "miles from bottom" and flash the button on
// every switch. Treating an id change as freshly-pinned suppresses that.

 *
 *  Why this exists, and why it can't just call autoScrollToBottom():
 *  renderMessages() rebuilds the thread via innerHTML, which resets the
 *  container's scrollTop to 0. The browser then fires a scroll event for that
 *  reset — and per the HTML spec the scroll steps run BEFORE requestAnimation-
 *  Frame callbacks in the same frame. So the scroll listener sees scrollTop≈0,
 *  concludes "miles from the bottom", and clears scrollPinnedToBottom a beat
 *  BEFORE our deferred (pin-respecting) scroll would run. A pin-aware scroll
 *  therefore reads false and bails, stranding the view a few messages up even
 *  though the user never scrolled away. (This is exactly the end-of-stream
 *  "hops up instead of sinking to the bottom" symptom.)
 *
 *  The cure is to decide using the follow state captured BEFORE the rebuild,
 *  then issue a FORCED scrollToBottom() (no respectPin) so the transient flip
 *  can't cancel it. The forced scroll moves the viewport to the true, settled
 *  bottom, and the scroll event that results re-confirms scrollPinnedToBottom
 *  = true. If the user had genuinely scrolled up mid-stream, wasFollowing is
 *  false and we leave them where they're reading, just keeping the FAB offered. */

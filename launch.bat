::   mergekit-produced GGUFs often have an incomplete or mangled
::   chat_template inherited from Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407's tool-calling

::   [TOOL_CALLS] sections and the model either fails to load, returns 500s,
::   or echoes the raw system prompt instead of chatting.
::
::   The fix for those models: drop --jinja and tell llama-server to use its
::   built-in C++ template by name (set MODEL_USE_JINJA=0 and
::   MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE=<name>). Available built-in template names include:

::   set an unrecognized name, llama-server treats the literal text as the
::   template body and the model is fed that constant string instead of your
::   chat (it ends up babbling about "tekken"). Use "mistral-v7" for Mistral

:: CHAT TEMPLATE HANDLING
::
:: --jinja tells llama-server to use the chat_template baked into the GGUF.
:: That's the default and works for most modern models (Gemma 4 channels,
:: gpt-oss Harmony, Mistral Small v7-tekken, Qwen3 think mode, etc.).
::
:: For a handful of families, --jinja produces garbage because the embedded
:: template is incomplete or contains Jinja constructs that minja can't
:: render. Mistral Nemo merges are the canonical example - see the comment
:: at the top of this script. For those, :identify_model sets:
::   MODEL_USE_JINJA=0
::   MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE=<built-in template name, e.g. mistral-v3-tekken>
:: which makes us pass --chat-template <name> instead of --jinja, using
:: llama-server's C++ reference implementation of the template.
::
:: Important: we ONLY pass --chat-template when MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE names a
:: built-in. Passing an arbitrary template name silently falls back to a
:: wrong format and causes the model to echo system info instead of
:: chatting - that's the footgun the old comment here was guarding against.

:: --parallel 1 pins the server to a single slot. The default ('auto'
:: -> 4 slots) splits the unified KV cache four ways and causes the
:: server to bounce between slots via LRU/LCP selection. With two
:: differently-shaped requests in flight (e.g. lore summarization +
:: chat completion), slot churn invalidates cached prefixes on both
:: sides, forcing a full prompt re-prefill (~27s on a 11K context).
:: One slot = consistent cache reuse = the followup chat call after
:: a summarization is fast instead of doing prefill from scratch.
::
:: --reasoning-format auto asks the server to route chain-of-thought
:: into a separate reasoning_content channel. Without it, CoT arrives
:: inline in 'content' and we rely entirely on the client-side parser.
:: With it, the server does the split for us and the client parser
:: becomes a safety net rather than the only line of defense. This is
:: a no-op for non-reasoning models, so it's safe to always pass.

:: Build optional flags conditionally so we don't accidentally emit
:: '--jinja' and '--chat-template <name>' together (mixing the two is
:: legal but defeats the point of routing around a broken Jinja template).
::
:: Precedence for the template source:
::   1. MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE_FILE -- a real .jinja file shipped with the
::      project (e.g. granite.jinja). REQUIRES --jinja to be honored as a
::      template (without --jinja, --chat-template-file is ignored). This
::      feeds our file INSTEAD of the GGUF's embedded template, so it both
::      sidesteps a broken embedded template and formats correctly. Used
::      for Granite, whose embedded template crashes the loader AND whose
::      built-in NAME doesn't resolve on current builds (it gets treated as
::      a literal template -- the model ends up fed just the word "granite").
::   2. MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE -- a built-in template NAME (e.g.
::      mistral-v3-tekken). Used with --jinja DISABLED; llama-server's C++
::      reference implementation renders it.
::   3. Neither -- plain --jinja, honoring the GGUF's embedded template.
